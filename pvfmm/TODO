Look at header files and think of organization
 - fmm_node, mpi_node, fmm_pts -> flatten
 - draw a graph of the PVFMM structure
 - compare with exaFMM structure
 - gradually make them similar (what do we need to change on the exaFMM side?)
Separate files and put more into src
 - Shorten compile time
Remove class hierarchy

Put ReadVal in utils.hpp
Remove "using"
