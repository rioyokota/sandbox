- Change function/variable names in tree.f
* kid -> child
* box -> cell
* laddr -> levelRange
- Use common blocks

Use implicit none
Remove goto
Remove continue
Allocatable -> Static array
ibox -> Ci

list 1 - the list of all boxes with which the
   box ibox interacts directly, including the boxes on the
   same level as ibox, boxes on the finer levels, and boxes
   on the coarser levels. obviously, list 1 is empty for any
   box that is not childless.
list 2 - the list of all boxes with which the
   box ibox interacts in the regular multipole fashion, i.e.
   boxes on the same level as ibox that are separated from it
   but whose parents are not separated from the parent of ibox.
list 3 - for a childless ibox, the list of all
   boxes on the levels finer than that of ibox, which are
   separated from ibox, and whose parents are not separated
   from ibox. for a box with children, list 3 is empty.
list 4 is dual to list 3, i.e. jbox is on the list 4 of ibox if
   and only if ibox is on the list 3 of jbox.
list 5 - the list of all boxes at the same level
   that are adjacent to the box ibox - the list of colleagues

1 - the level of subdivision on which this box was constructed
2,3,4 - the coordinates of this box among  all boxes on this level
5 - the parent of this box, identified by it address in array boxes
6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 - the  list of children of this box
   (eight of them, and the child is identified by its address
   in the array boxes; if a box has only one child, only the
   first of the four child entries is non-zero, etc.)
14 - the location in the array iz of the particles living in this box
15 - the number of particles living in this box
16 - the location in the array iztarg of the targets living in this box
17 - the number of targets living in this box
18 - source box type: 0 - empty, 1 - leaf node, 2 - sub-divided
19 - target box type: 0 - empty, 1 - leaf node, 2 - sub-divided
20 - reserved for future use
