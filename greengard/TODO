list 1 - the list of all boxes with which the
   box ibox interacts directly, including the boxes on the
   same level as ibox, boxes on the finer levels, and boxes
   on the coarser levels. obviously, list 1 is empty for any
   box that is not childless.
list 2 - the list of all boxes with which the
   box ibox interacts in the regular multipole fashion, i.e.
   boxes on the same level as ibox that are separated from it
   but whose parents are not separated from the parent of ibox.
list 3 - for a childless ibox, the list of all
   boxes on the levels finer than that of ibox, which are
   separated from ibox, and whose parents are not separated
   from ibox. for a box with children, list 3 is empty.
list 4 is dual to list 3, i.e. jbox is on the list 4 of ibox if
   and only if ibox is on the list 3 of jbox.
list 5 - the list of all boxes at the same level
   that are adjacent to the box ibox - the list of colleagues
